I want to create a custom alarm clock software. I wanted my project to be something that could be of use and have individual input to the users. Imagine a custom alarm where you could import your own sound or song. Once you've chosen your desired time, the alarm will keep pace with the current time in sync. The alarm sounds as soon as the times are same. Other ongoing projects I found on Github can be used to assist create this application. Many of us would oversleep without alarms and arrive late for work. Even while sleeping in sounds wonderful, being timely is a hard reality we frequently have to accept. Whether you want extra sleep or not, setting a specific time to arrive at work or school can be necessary for everything to operate well. This is a solo project and will be worked on by me independently with the use of similar projects .
